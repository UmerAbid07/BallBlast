Name: Ball Blast
Reason to make this game:
I choose This Game as it was my idea that it is more challenging than the rest
Hurdels I faced:
I faced a lot of problems and hurdles like I was unable to understand which line of code belongs to what
GameObject and how to make scripts communicate with each other and make scoreSystem
How I overcome them:
I spent a lot of time in troubleshooting and in score I just revise my previous task(Codes) and than i realize I was missing Static datatype.That was a mistake.
And Scripts communication topic was way to time consuming because the actual thing was missing was a narrow miss at that time i was unable to understand
which code will be writen to which GameObject and then the scripts will communicate easily Thanks to Dayyan. Honestly we took a Zoom meeting and Dayyan suggests
me some options and prior to that he suggest me a break hahahhah
Completion:
Although I can"t give much time to my this project as particles and animation is missing which I'll add when I will made a WebGL Link and
Next Class you will see my full game with scene butt for now i've missed that which was easy
